# Climate-Change-using-ML


Climate change prediction using the linear regression model
The temperature of any place in mainly dependent on 5 factors.
In this code we use the linear regression model to correlate the relation between atmospheric pressure and temperature over the past years.
To run the code:

1.Enter the name of the place you want prediction for

2.Enter start and end dates.

3.Matplotlib module is used to show the predicted v/s actual temperature

With this model we can see that there is a significant difference in the predicted temperature and the actual temperature. This means that climate change is real and it should be a problem we all are supposed to be concerned about.
